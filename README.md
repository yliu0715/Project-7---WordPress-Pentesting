## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while doing the work
- One challenge I encountered was that I was unable to use XSS payloads as a filename in Windows, so I had to do this on Kali and it was not convenient considering the fact that I needed to record a gif of the process. But LiceCap is only available on Windows and not Kali so there were some difficulties there.
